# Steeriously SDL2 Example

## This is an example program for using Steeriously with the SDL graphics library. 

It is provided for illustrative purposes only, no care was taken to get the
most performance, there may be bugs, but it should be enough to get you started.

Rotation is not available as a property of SDL_Rect, so an update will be issues soon implementing the proper geometric transformation for the steering entities. Perhaps using SDL_Surface instead of only SDL_Rect.
